 * Envelope Savings Calculator
 *
 * This program helps you calculate your savings based on the envelope method.
 * It asks for the total number of days to save and the starting contribution.
 * Then, it calculates the daily contribution for each day by multiplying the starting contribution with the day number.
 * The total savings is updated by adding the daily contribution to it.
 * Finally, it prints the daily contributions and the total savings after the specified number of days.
